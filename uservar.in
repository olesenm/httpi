*** The restrictions matrix is documented in the manual. The keys are the
    filepaths and the values are the matrices themselves.

*** The host redirect matrix is also documented, the keys being the simulated
    host names and the values being the redirect prefix. 

### THESE ARE JUST EXAMPLES: YOU SHOULD CHANGE TO YOUR OWN. :-) IF YOU AREN'T
    USING THE RESTRICTIONS MATRIX AND/OR HOST REDIRECTION, THEY WILL BE
    AUTOMAGICALLY IGNORED. ###
