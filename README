Be sure you read the LICENSE file and the INSTALL file!!! The LICENSE
file, especially, because HTTPi is NOT GPL. It's free, but it's NOT GPL.

--

HTTPi's current web home, as well as all the documentation your little heart
or other internal organs could desire, is at

	http://stockholm.ptloma.edu/httpi/

Running vanilla HTTPi, of course, with no extra Perl modules. Just the
executable, a bottle of wine, and thou. The manuals and documentation for
patching and using HTTPi are all there.

If you plan to be using a lot of executables, read the manual first. They
differ in HTTPi -- not violently, but significantly. CGIs won't work out
of the box, most likely.


Suggestions, patches, questions, bug reports?

	httpi@stockholm.ptloma.edu

I would really love feedback, so please, send me an E-mail and let me know
what you think.
