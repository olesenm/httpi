You're using HTTPi, the coolest little webserver out there! Thanks!

** Important difference between 1.2.x and all previous versions, and 1.3:
   most system content types are now in httpi.in -- only user overrides and
   user-defined types should go in uservar.in. However, 1.2.x-style
   uservar.in files should still work -- but they will make an unnecessarily
   large executable! **

** We've MOVED! Look for us at http://httpi.floodgap.com/! **

Be sure you read the LICENSE file and the INSTALL file! The LICENSE
file, especially, because HTTPi is NOT GPL. It's free, but it's NOT GPL.

To install, see the INSTALL file in this directory, but the documentation
on the official HTTPi webpage will probably be all the help you'll ever need.
HTTPi's current web home, as well as all the documentation your little heart
or other internal organs could desire, is located at:

	http://httpi.floodgap.com/

Running vanilla HTTPi, of course, with no extra Perl modules. Just the
executable, a bottle of wine, and thou. The manuals and documentation for
patching and using HTTPi are all there.

If you plan to be using a lot of executables, read the manual first. They
differ in HTTPi -- not violently, but significantly. CGIs won't work out
of the box, most likely.


Suggestions, patches, questions, bug reports?

I would really love feedback, so please, send me an E-mail and let me know
what you think.
