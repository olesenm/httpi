Changes since first 1.0:

	* fixed configure-time bug that caused syntax errors if preparsing
		not turned on. duh. thanks Fergus Gallagher.
	* better socket handling for Demonic
	
Changes since 0.99:

	* logging. one final change: user, since it's not through identd,
		should be in the second -. so, fixed. that's it! that's all the
		changes I'm going to make to that! finito!
	* fixed: bug in HTTPerl and POST executables where a runtime over
		10sec causes premature termination. no real damage but
		inexplicable behaviour was quite annoying (very subtle bug)
	* first preparsing support for inline Perl. ewwww icky gross inline
		perl ptui spit. you specify the extensions, you cover the
		damage your users do with the server's UID (and don't say you
		weren't warned). also adds &output and &flush methods, and
		.shtm?l? MIME types
	* fixed: perl ./configure didn't work. oops
	* added lzh lha pdf fdf MIME types
	* mild methods tweak to how hostname/IP info is stored. now cached
		if the restriction matrix already looked that info up
	* transcript files are now version tagged to stop upgrade snarls

Changes since 0.7:

	* logging ... didn't change. phew, for once :-)
	* user file system allows http://foo/~bar/, getpwnam() check added
	* don't be running no root-owned executables now ;-) it didn't run
		them before either but the error was very cryptic
	* HTTP authentication through restriction matrix
	* better HTTP/0.9 support, especially for 301 responses
	* IP-less virtual hosting (new global %nameredir)
	* configure.xinetd no longer depends on /etc/services
	* configure.inetd patched for really anal inetd systems (like HP/UX)
	* 404 and 301 responses now handled by dedicated subroutines
	* authentication check now precedes file existence check for allowing
		modules to be protected
	* new global $raddress now contains resolved filesystem address
	* alarm() no longer required but really really really recommended
		(this to help porting HTTPi to non-Unixy things)
	* statios statistics module (demonic only)
	* hostname lookups may be turned off for speed (sheesh, 150% boost
		in Demonic mode)
	* some extra MIME types
	* new utilities: crapword, browsed (see instructions)

Changes since 0.4:

	* IP-based virtual hosting (xinetd and demonic only)
	* argh!!!! I *still* can't get logging right!!! fixed to once and
		for all obey CERN spec
	* new daemonized version (configure.demonic)
	* subtle bug where sock_to_host returns nil could corrupt logs. fixed.
	* configure.inetd now NIS aware
	* tons (too many) new environment variables for executables a la CGI
		1.1 specification
	* now aware of its host name, always a good thing :-)
	* checks for alarm() and fork() availability in your Perl
	* incomplete configures left null transcripts. fixed.
	* error conditions in conquests.pl would sometimes give spurious
		"conquests.pl not found" errors. fixed.
	* HTTPerl allows same interpreter instance to be reused for speed
	* version string now reflects OS type and configure type
	* HEAD now correctly logs actual data transferred
	* HTTP/1.1 requests in non-1.1 mode come back as HTTP/1.0 (RFC
		compliancy issue)

Changes since 0.1:

	* new environment variables: HTTP_REFERER, HTTP_USER_AGENT
	* REMOTE_ADDR and REMOTE_HOST no longer equivalent, in line with CGI
		spec
	* fixed CERN date bug
	* your choice of logging: with referer/useragent, with referer, or
		neither
	* user agent now acquired in this version
	* restriction matrix security
	* generic configure script for non-inetd systems
	* xinetd configure script for xinetd systems
	* common config questions and subroutines moved to conquests.pl
		and consubs.pl, respectively
	* sock_to_host internal function hardcoded to use STDIN filehandle
	* new globals $httpua, %restrictions
