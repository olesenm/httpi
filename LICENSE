HTTPi is (C)1998, 1999 Cameron Kaiser. All rights reserved.

** While HTTPi is free, it is NOT distributed under CopyLeft or GPL. Please **
** read on to find out what the differences are. Licenses protect author    **
** rights -- please honour them, even with free software packages.          **

You can modify and tweak HTTPi to your heart's content. You don't need to
pay me for using it, and you don't need my permission to make changes (though
I or an authorised maintainer will be the only ones checking code back into
HTTPi's code base for authorised patches and new versions).

HTTPi must be free, and any and all distributions and derivatives must
themselves be free. "Derivatives" shall constitute distributions with code
added or removed from the base distribution, or distributions that are
signficantly based on the source code (though may not necessarily include
the source code itself). This means a C port of HTTPi is still a derivative,
or a Win32 version, or whatever. You do not have to provide source code,
which is a deviation from GPL.

You may NOT:

	* make changes and slap your copyright on the entire package. Your
	  copyright extends only to the changes you've made. My copyright
	  remains.

	* supersede the license agreement here. You may not charge for a
	  HTTPi distribution, for example (though you may include it as part
	  of a larger distribution as long as it is not being purchased as an
	  item). Derivatives count as distributions. This license agreement,
	  therefore, applies IN FULL to any distribution or derivative work.

	  You also MAY NOT place your derivative work under GPL, because that
	  is a different, though similar, licensing agreement, and the
	  License here does reflect constraints that are mutually exclusive.

	* make a distribution of HTTPi that does not include ALL files,
	  including this license, and ONLY these files. If not, it is a
	  derivative work, and you may NOT call it an official distribution.

	* make or distribute a distribution of HTTPi that does not clearly
	  state the copyright (i.e.

Contains [or is based on] the HTTPi web server
(C)1998, 1999 Cameron Kaiser. All rights reserved.

	  would be just about perfect), or make or distribute a derivative of
	  HTTPi that does not clearly state the copyright.

You MUST:

	* copyright your derivative works. You may not make them
	  public domain.

Exceptions to these restrictions must be obtained from me, the copyright
holder, IN WRITING.

I reserve the right to interpret this document, and I also reserve the right
to make license changes without notice effective on issue date.

Other than that, have a blast! Keep software free.
