** While HTTPi is free, it is NOT distributed under CopyLeft or GPL. Please **

** rights -- please honour them, even with free software packages.          **

You can modify and tweak HTTPi to your heart's content. You don't need to
pay me for using it, and you don't need my permission to make changes (though
I or an authorised maintainer will be the only ones checking code back into
HTTPi's code base for authorised patches and new versions).

Really, there's only one overriding principle that I insist on for HTTPi --
it must be free, and any and all distributions and derivatives of it must
themselves be free. By free software I do not necessarily mean free in the
way that Richard Stallman of GNU fame might -- merely that such works be
without cost. Your sources may be open or closed at your desire, and may
even be proprietary, but you must not ask any fee for it. However, certain
allowances are made for special for-profit distribution circumstances below.

In the below conditions, "derivative works" constitute distributions with code
added or removed from the base distribution, or distributions that are
significantly based on the source code (though may not necessarily include
the source code itself), in the Author's sole judgement. This means a C port
of HTTPi is still a derivative, or a Win32 version, or whatever.

On the other hand, if you do NOT include HTTPi or code derived from HTTPi in
your work, then it is NOT a derivative work or distribution (even if your
application requires HTTPi to function), and these license terms do not apply
to your work as long as HTTPi or HTTPi-derived code is not included. You may
place such works under any license you like. Otherwise, please read on.

You MAY NOT:

	* make changes and slap your copyright on the entire package. Your
	  copyright extends only to the changes you've made. My copyright,
	  and any copyrights asserted by HTTPi's contributors, remain.

	* supersede the license agreement here with your own terms or
	  requirements. As these license terms apply to any HTTPi-derived
	  code, you MAY NOT supersede them in a derivative work either, and
	  you MAY NOT select only certain terms of this License to apply. It
	  applies in full, period.

	  You MAY choose to ADD additional license terms to your derivative
	  work, but they MAY NOT conflict with this License. As a corollary,
	  you MAY NOT place your derivative work under GPL, because that
	  is a different, though similar, licensing agreement and the
	  License here does reflect constraints that are mutually exclusive.
	  Again, this does not apply to projects related to HTTPi that
	  *do not* include HTTPi or HTTPi-derived code, even if HTTPi is
	  required for them to function.

	* Despite the fact you MAY NOT charge a fee for a HTTPi distribution
	  or a derivative work based on it, there are circumstances where
	  HTTPi can still be part of a for-profit work if certain conditions
	  are met.

	  You MAY use HTTPi as the server solution to serve any commercial
	  content, freely accessible or otherwise, as you are considered to
	  be charging a fee for the products, content and services you sell
	  via HTTPi, not for HTTPi itself, as long as said content does not
	  involve distribution of HTTPi or a derivative work in violation of
	  the other terms of this License.

	  You MAY charge a fee for a product you sell that includes HTTPi as
	  a bundled extra, as long as HTTPi is included in its unmodified
	  distribution state with ALL files, including this license (see below)
	  and you must also make HTTPi available for free separately (i.e.,
	  you are requesting a fee for your product, and HTTPi is merely
	  bundled as a free extra for the convenience of your users). Operating
	  system distributions are, for example, specifically permitted.

	  However, if you make any modifications to HTTPi, then you MAY NOT
	  sell it in any aggregate form (OS distributions, bundled extra or
	  otherwise) if HTTPi or HTTPi-derived code is included, unless you
	  make the derivative work separately available without cost in
	  addition.

	  You MAY charge a fee for a HTTPi installation providing you also
	  make the software available for free (i.e., you are requesting a fee
	  for the act of installation, not for the software you install).

	* make a distribution of HTTPi that does not include ALL files,
	  including this license, and ONLY these files. If not, it is a
	  derivative work, and you may NOT call it an official distribution.

	* make or distribute a distribution of HTTPi that does not clearly
	  state the copyright (i.e.

Contains or is based on the HTTPi web server

	  would be just about perfect), or make or distribute a derivative of
	  HTTPi that does not clearly state the copyright.

You MUST:

	* copyright your derivative works. You may not make them public domain.

	* include this LICENSE agreement in any and all derivative
	  works you create, as either a separate file or part of your
	  non-mutually exclusive license (that is, does not conflict
	  with these terms, as stated above).

	* absolve the programmers of HTTPi (including yours truly :-) and
	  any contributors) of any liability, real or imagined, and certify
	  that you are using this program AT YOUR OWN RISK. While the
	  programmers shall endeavour to make HTTPi as bug-free as possible,
	  entomological phenomena can and do occur. Such is life.

	  If you make a derivative work of HTTPi, you MAY decide that you
	  wish to offer warranty support. You may do so, but your doing so
	  does in no way make me, the programmers of HTTPi, or anyone else
	  liable for the fulfillment of your warranty, and you and the users
	  of your derivative work must agree to hold us legally blameless
	  under ALL circumstances. (Remember, no mutually exclusive license
	  terms in your derivative works, right?)

Your usage of this program constitutes your binding acceptance of these
terms. Don't even think about starting HTTPi up on your system if you don't
agree to follow the terms detailed in this license IN THEIR ENTIRETY. Don't
even think about modifying it, patching it or distributing it if you don't,
either. Exceptions to these restrictions must be obtained from me, the
copyright holder, IN WRITING.

I reserve the right to interpret this document, and I also reserve the right
to make license changes without notice effective on issue date. All legal
issues shall be dealt with in accordance with the State of California, United
States of America. The most current copy of this license is always available
from HTTPi's home page at http://httpi.floodgap.com/

Thanks for reading the fine print and respecting author's rights. Have a
blast!
