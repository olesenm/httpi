** Installation procedure for HTTPi/0.7
** Copyright 1998, 1999 Cameron Kaiser

1. Check that all files are present. Make sure you have Perl 5 installed.
   You only need the executable, not the standard distribution in full.

2. Read the LICENSE file.

3. Read the LICENSE file.

4. Read the ... have you read it yet?

5. Determine which configure file you should be running on your platform.
YOUR PERL MUST HAVE alarm() TO INSTALL *AT ALL*!

configure.inetd		Most Unix boxen. Use this if you use the vanilla
			inetd. Will autoconfigure your files for you if root.

configure.xinetd	For users of the xinetd clone http://synack.net/xinetd/
			Will autoconfigure your files for you. Tres cool.

configure.demonic	For Demonic HTTPi, the daemonised version. You'll
			either need Socket.pm, a C compiler, or a list of
			your system's socket constants. Your Perl must also
			support fork().

configure.generic	Don't know what inetd you have, or one I don't support
			yet. You'll have to connect HTTPi to your inetd
			yourself.

demonic is the fastest and easiest to set up (you don't need to be root), but
requires some special care and feeding. See the documentation.

xinetd is vewwy vewwy fast. If you have the means, I highly recommend it. (To
quote Ferris Bueller.) You'll realise about a 25% speed increase with it,
at least according to my numbers. It assumes, however, that your .conf file
is /etc/xinetd.conf, which is xinetd's default.

Many of you will be running configure.inetd, so for backwards compatibility
it's still named configure (just a symlink to configure.inetd).

Make sure that consubs.pl and conquests.pl are in the current directory.

6. Run that config file.

$ perl configure.inetd	# most unices that want inetd installation
$ perl configure.xinetd	# smart unices/sysadmins that want inetd installation
$ perl configure.demonic # most unices that don't want inetd installation
$ perl configure.generic # others

NOTE TO (x)inetd INSTALLERS:
If you're on a Unix box, you must run as root for full install options.
Any user can build an object, but only root can modify your (x)inetd's
configuration files.

7. Follow the handy and verbose prompts. The configure program may have
   additional directions to follow. Follow them.

8. If configure bombs, feel free to contact me with the error message at

	httpi@stockholm.ptloma.edu
