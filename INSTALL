1. Check that all files are present and proper size (see Manifest). Make sure
   you have Perl 5 installed. You only need the executable.

2. Read the LICENSE file.

3. Read the LICENSE file.

4. Read the ... have you read it yet?

5. Determine which configure file you should be running on your platform.
YOU NEED AN INETD OR MORAL EQUIVALENT. NO EXCEPTIONS!

configure.inetd		Most Unix boxen. Use this if you use the vanilla
			inetd. Will autoconfigure your files for you if root.

configure.xinetd	For users of the xinetd clone http://synack.net/xinetd/
			Will autoconfigure your files for you. Tres cool.

configure.generic	Don't know what inetd you have, or one I don't support
			yet. Win32, Mac users should run this right now. Tells
			you what configuration changes you need to make.

xinetd is vewwy vewwy fast. If you have the means, I highly recommend it. (To
quote Ferris Bueller.) You'll realise about a 25% speed increase with it,
at least according to my numbers. It assumes, however, that your .conf file
is /etc/xinetd.conf, which is xinetd's default.

Most of you will be running configure.inetd, so for backwards compatibility
it's still named configure (just a symlink to configure.inetd).

Make sure that consubs.pl and conquests.pl are in the current directory.

6. Run that config file.

$ perl configure.inetd	# most unices
$ perl configure.xinetd	# smart unices/sysadmins
C:\>perl.exe configure.generic		# Win32, Mac, others

If you're on a Unix box, run as root for full install options,
or any other user just to build an object.

7. Follow the handy and verbose prompts. The configure program may have
   additional directions to follow. Follow them.
