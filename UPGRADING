** Upgrading protocol for HTTPi
** Copyright 1999-2008 Cameron Kaiser

To make HTTPi as easy as possible to migrate between versions, I have created
specific upgrading instructions to facilitate the process.

Due to the issue of maintaining two versions of this file, I have changed
this one to simply point out that this document is available as part of the
downloadable documentation, or can be read here:

	http://httpi.floodgap.com/upgrade.html

Please send any questions or concerns about the recommended process to
httpi@floodgap.com .
